# All CBDC Banking Simulation Hypotheses - Line by Line

## Hypothesis H1: Differential Network Centrality Impact

**Main Statement:**
CBDC introduction disproportionately reduces network centrality for small-medium banks compared to large banks, creating a more concentrated banking network structure.

**Detailed Breakdown:**
- Large banks have superior resources to compete with CBDC
- Large banks maintain stronger customer loyalty
- Large banks benefit from network effects that amplify their advantages
- Small banks face higher vulnerability due to limited competitive capabilities
- Small banks cannot match CBDC interest rates or convenience features
- Large banks start with initial centrality of 0.8
- Small-medium banks start with initial centrality of 0.3
- Large banks represent 20% of institutions but hold 60% of market capital
- Small-medium banks represent 80% of institutions but hold only 40% of market capital
- After CBDC introduction, large banks maintain centrality in 0.6-0.8 range
- After CBDC introduction, small banks decline to 0.1-0.2 centrality range
- The centrality gap between large and small banks increases over time
- This creates a more concentrated banking network structure
- Market concentration increases systemic risk from "too big to fail" institutions
- This may require regulatory intervention to prevent excessive concentration

## Hypothesis H2: Small Bank Vulnerability

**Main Statement:**
Small banks are more vulnerable to CBDC competition due to limited resources and customer loyalty.

**Detailed Breakdown:**
- Small banks have 80% CBDC vulnerability compared to 40% for large banks
- Small banks have only 30% customer retention rate
- Large banks have 70% customer retention rate
- Small banks cannot compete on interest rates due to cost structure
- Small banks have limited technology resources to improve digital services
- Small banks lose customers faster when CBDC becomes available
- Small banks have fewer resources to invest in competitive responses
- Small banks face higher operational costs relative to their asset base
- Small banks have less diversified revenue streams
- Small banks are more dependent on traditional deposit-based business models
- Small banks have weaker brand recognition compared to large institutions
- Small banks serve more price-sensitive customer segments
- Small banks have limited ability to cross-subsidize competitive rates
- This vulnerability creates asymmetric impacts across the banking sector

## Hypothesis H3: Systemic Liquidity Stress

**Main Statement:**
Rapid CBDC adoption creates systemic liquidity stress in the commercial banking sector, particularly during periods of accelerated consumer switching.

**Detailed Breakdown:**
- Bank runs and deposit flight are amplified by digital currency convenience
- CBDC allows instant switching away from bank deposits
- Liquidity stress concentrates in vulnerable institutions first
- Network effects accelerate stress contagion across the banking system
- Liquidity stress is measured as a composite of deposit volatility, reserve adequacy, and competitive pressure
- Customer loss rate increases during rapid CBDC adoption periods
- Deposit volatility spikes when consumers switch to CBDC
- Competitive pressure intensifies with higher CBDC adoption rates
- Systemic risk threshold is reached when >30% of banks show high stress levels
- Crisis periods occur when sustained stress levels exceed 0.7 threshold
- Stress levels spike when CBDC adoption exceeds 20%
- Small banks show higher and more persistent liquidity stress
- Stress can trigger central bank intervention as lender of last resort
- Recovery patterns depend on the speed of CBDC adoption
- Gradual adoption allows banks time to adjust their business models
- Rapid adoption creates more severe and concentrated stress periods
- This requires enhanced liquidity monitoring and stress testing

## Hypothesis H4: Banking Network Connectivity Decline

**Main Statement:**
CBDC weakens traditional interbank network connections as direct central bank-consumer relationships reduce intermediation needs.

**Detailed Breakdown:**
- CBDC provides an alternative to traditional interbank settlement systems
- Direct central bank relationships bypass commercial banking networks
- Reduced intermediation decreases interbank dependency
- Network density measures the ratio of actual connections to maximum possible connections
- Large banks initially have 60% connectivity with other banks
- Small banks initially have 30% connectivity with other banks
- Significant decline in connectivity occurs when CBDC adoption exceeds 20%
- Network density shows steady decline after CBDC introduction
- Connection loss accelerates when adoption rates increase rapidly
- Small banks lose interbank connections faster than large banks
- Maximum possible connections decrease as some banks exit the market
- Interbank lending relationships weaken with reduced deposit volumes
- Payment system infrastructure changes to accommodate direct CBDC flows
- Network fragmentation can occur as banks become more isolated
- This affects monetary policy transmission through banking channels
- Traditional correspondent banking relationships may become obsolete
- New network structures emerge around CBDC infrastructure
- This requires changes in financial system supervision and regulation

## Hypothesis H5: Systemic Importance Integration

**Main Statement:**
Bank centrality influences systemic importance and stress propagation across the banking system.

**Detailed Breakdown:**
- Network effects amplify the impact of systemically important banks
- Highly connected banks can either amplify or contain systemic stress
- Bank centrality directly influences systemic importance scoring
- More central banks have greater potential for contagion effects
- Stress propagation follows network connection patterns
- Large banks with high centrality can stabilize or destabilize the system
- Regulatory response is triggered by systemic importance metrics
- Central bank intervention priorities are based on network centrality
- Bank failure impact depends on network position and connectivity
- Too-connected-to-fail becomes as important as too-big-to-fail
- Network analysis becomes essential for financial stability assessment
- Systemic risk measurement must incorporate network centrality measures
- Policy interventions should consider network effects and propagation paths
- This integration affects how regulators monitor and respond to banking sector stress

## Hypothesis H6: Central Bank Network Dominance

**Main Statement:**
CBDC transforms the central bank from a peripheral regulatory entity into the dominant node in the financial network through direct consumer relationships.

**Detailed Breakdown:**
- CBDC creates direct central bank-consumer connections
- These connections bypass traditional commercial banking intermediation
- Monopoly CBDC issuer position provides structural network advantage
- Central bank starts with minimal network centrality of 0.1 (regulatory role only)
- Network centrality increases with CBDC adoption rate and market share
- Adoption rate can contribute up to 60% boost to centrality
- Market share can contribute up to 40% boost to centrality
- Monopoly position provides additional 20% boost when adoption exceeds 30%
- Central bank centrality can grow from 0.1 to 0.8+ with high CBDC adoption
- Dominance threshold is reached when central bank centrality exceeds average commercial bank centrality
- Dominance ratio can exceed 2x-3x the commercial bank average
- Network topology shifts from bank-centric to central bank-centric structure
- This represents a fundamental change in monetary system architecture
- Central bank operational responsibilities expand significantly
- Financial stability oversight requirements change dramatically
- Traditional banking disintermediation accelerates with central bank dominance
- New regulatory frameworks needed for central bank-dominant networks
- This affects the entire structure of financial intermediation in the economy

## Testing Framework Applied to All Hypotheses

**Experimental Design:**
- Baseline period of 30 simulation steps (2.5 years) before CBDC introduction
- CBDC intervention introduced at step 30 with demand-driven supply
- Observation period of 90-120 steps (7.5-10 years) after introduction
- Traditional banking parameters held constant as control variables

**Statistical Measures:**
- Time series trend analysis of key metrics before and after CBDC
